# Loop Through a List
# You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Print all items in the list, one by one:

# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for x in thislist:
#   print(x)



# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# for x in thistuple:
#   print(x)



# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Loop through the set, and print the values:

# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# for x in thisset:
#   print(x)
